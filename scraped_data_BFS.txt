ABOUT AHS

WHO WE ARE

Alberta Health Services (AHS) is proud to be part of Canada’s first and largest provincewide, integrated health system, responsible for delivering health services to more than 4.4 million people living in Alberta, as well as to some residents of Saskatchewan, B.C. and the Northwest Territories.

AHS has more than 112,300 direct AHS employees (excluding Covenant Health and other contracted service providers) and more than 13,000 staff working in AHS’ wholly-owned subsidiaries such as Alberta Precision Laboratories, Carewest and CapitalCare Group. AHS is also supported by approximately 9,100 volunteers and more than 11,000 physicians practicing in Alberta, approximately 9,000 of whom are members of the AHS medical staff (including active, temporary and community appointments).

Students from Alberta’s universities and colleges, as well as from universities and colleges outside of Alberta, receive clinical education in AHS facilities and community locations.

AHS has 106 acute care hospitals, five stand-alone psychiatric facilities, 8,523 acute care beds, 28,360 continuing care beds/spaces and 3,077 addiction and mental health beds/spaces, plus equity partnership in 40 primary care networks.

Programs and services are offered at more than 900 facilities throughout the province, including hospitals, clinics, continuing care facilities, cancer centres, mental health facilities and community health sites.

The province also has an extensive network of community-based services designed to assist Albertans in maintaining and improving their overall health status.

OUR HISTORY

Canada’s first provincewide, integrated health system, announced on May 15, 2008, by Ron Liepert, Minister of Health and Wellness.

We bring together 12 formerly separate health entities in the province including three geographically based health authorities, Alberta Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission (AADAC), Alberta Mental Health Board and Alberta Cancer Board. Ground ambulance service was added to the responsibilities of AHS in an announcement from Alberta Health and Wellness on May 30, 2008. The services were moved from municipalities to AHS effective April 1, 2009.

OUR PEOPLE

AHS supports our people by creating a culture in which we all feel safe, healthy, and valued, and can reach our full potential.

To accomplish this, AHS has set a clear vision, with a shared purpose and common goals. AHS is committed to developing excellent leadership that will respect, value and support our people and provide the resources needed to work together effectively.
